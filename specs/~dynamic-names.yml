overview: |
  Rationale: this special notation was introduced specifically to allow the
  dynamic loading of partials. The main advantage that this notation
  offers is to allow dynamic loading of partials, which is particularly useful
  in cases where polymorphic data needs to be rendered, or in cases where
  a child template is shared by multiple parent templates; cases which
  otherwise would be possible to render only by using either complex (and
  optional) features such as lambdas, or by using solutions that are inefficient
  both in terms of space and in terms of computational efficiency, such as:
  overloading the template with if blocks or preprocessing the template.

  Dynamic Names are a special notation to dynamically determine a tag's content.

  Dynamic Names MUST be a non-whitespace character sequence NOT containing
  the current closing delimiter. A Dynamic Name consists of an asterisk,
  followed by a dotted name. The latter follows the same notation as in an
  Interpolation tag.

  This tag's dotted name, which is the Dynamic Name excluding the
  leading asterisk, references a key in the context whose value will be used in
  place of the Dynamic Name itself as content of the tag. The dotted name
  resolution produces the same value as an Interpolation tag and does not affect
  the context for further processing.

  Set Delimiter tags MUST NOT affect the resolution of a Dynamic Name. The
  Dynamic Names MUST be resolved against the context stack local to the tag.
  Failed resolution of the dynamic name SHOULD result in nothing being rendered.

  Engines that implement Dynamic Names MUST support their use in Partial tags.
  In engines that also implement the optional inheritance spec, Dynamic Names
  inside Parent tags should be supported as well. Dynamic Names cannot be
  resolved more than once (Dynamic Names cannot be nested).
